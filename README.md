# Smartphone-Price-Predictor

## **Objective**
Finding a smartphone within budget can be tricky with so many options. This project simplifies the process by predicting smartphone prices based on user preferences like **RAM, Brand, Battery, Camera, and more**. Users can enter their requirements through an interactive interface and get an instant price prediction using a machine learning model.


### **Model Performance**  
The trained model achieves an R² score of **0.89 (89%)**, indicating strong predictive performance in estimating smartphone prices based on user preferences.
